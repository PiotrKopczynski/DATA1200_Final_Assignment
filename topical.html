                    Since they have to be mostly driven on roads, people using
                    the e-scooter need to have basic knowledge of traffic laws.

                    Technological innovations can improve the lives of disadvantaged people in
                    many ways. At the same time, the consumption of electronic devices has an
                    environmental cost. <p> What are your thoughts about this dilemma?

                        Instead of using technological innovations, more people could be hired to help
                        disadvantaged people to function normally.

                        People need to learn how to properly care for their devices so they can last

                        Next generation users of electronic devices need to be educated in
                        sustainable use of “use and throw” articles like a mobile phone.

                    <li>
                        Producers of electronic devices have to engage in the full life cycle of their
                        products, from production to use and recycling of scarce materials.

                        Apple needs to stop producing new Iphones so people will stop buying new

                        A possible way of viewing the issue is that when disadvantaged people
                        receive technological aids, they have the potential to become functional
                        members of society that contribute to saving the environment through
                        innovation.

                        People with disabilities should have first priority in the use of electronic
                        devices since it enhances their life value. Fully able people don't need the

                        Disadvantaged people are not worth the environmental cost so the
